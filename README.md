A project and app to improve the behavior of concerned persons in public departments in Pakistan. And also a little reward to those kind-hearted and nice persons who perform their duty well and help those who need their help.

## Why?

I met many people in my life in public organizations like Universities, Hospitals, etc. Some of them treated me very well and performed their duty. But some of them are the worst people I ever saw. The government pays them and provides facilities to serve us not because they got a degree of BS or MS but to serve us and perform their duty. But instead of serving us, they become masters of us. They make us feel we are inferior creatures. They yell at us. They postpone our work to days and weeks. People who come from distant areas spend a lot of time and money and make requests to them but they sit in their office and say come tomorrow. Today we have no time for you.
        I suffered this pain a lot. At my university, I am suffering since last month, and still, I did not get my clearance done. They have the entries of the payment of my fees I submitted all challans receipts but still, they are making me suffer from different penalties. Shame on such Organizations, their systems, and their egoistic employyes.

## Request
	I made this app opensource so you trust the app and share it to others. Help others to improve our country and its officials. To maintain server costs I am putting Google and facebook ads in the app which can be turned off, If you do not like the ads. But to make this project keep going and fulfill server costs please consider some donations. This app does not collect any of your data.
